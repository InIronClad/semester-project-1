							<h1>History of Christmas and the Celebrations That Influenced it</h1>
						
							<p>Christmas, as it relates to Christianity, goes back to at least 300CE. However, that is the
							religious component. As time passed and the celebration developed, tradtions from many pagan
							religions were attached to it. The time leading up to Christmas, Advent, incorporated Saturnalian
							traditions in Italy during the Middle Ages. In the High Middle Ages, traditions from both Saturnalia
							and Yule were incorporated, which included carolling and the Yule boar. </p>
							
							<h2>Saturnalia</h2>
							
							<p>Santurnalia was a Roman festival in honor of Saturn, the top Roman god. It was held from the 17th
							of December, on the Julian calendar, and extended to the 23rd of December. This festival was celebrated
							with a sacrifice at the Temple of Saturn, and a public feast. This was followed by gift-giving and
							continual partying.</p>
							
							<h2>Yule</h2>
							
							<p>Yule was a pagan religious festival celebrated by Germanic peoples, before it was assimilated by
							Christianity and became part of the Christmas celebrations. Similar terms for Yule have been found
							in Norse traditions, and the god Odin is associated with Yule.</p>

							<h3>Fun Historical Facts</h3>
							
							<ul>
								<li>Christmas has assimilated so many pagan or non-christian traditions into Christmas that the total
								input of the religion is less than that of the pagan and non-christian traditions.</li>
								<li>Jesus' birth date was most likely chosen to be in December to coincide with the winter solstice,
								and so draw pagans into the religion.</li>
								<li>Jesus Christ was most likely born some time in June of the Gregorian calendar.</li>
