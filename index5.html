							<h1>Welcome to Christmastime!</h1>

							<p>
							A large number of nations observe Christmas as a public holiday, and is celebrated culturally 
							by former and non-Christians. These celebrations have a mix of Christian, pre-Christian, and
							secular themes. important and popular traditions of the holiday include gift-giving, carolling,
							and decorating one's house with lights. A figure with a number of names including Santa Claus 
							is central to the cultural holiday, as he brings presents to good children on Christmas Eve 
							while everyone sleeps. To accomplish this, he uses a sleigh pulled by reindeer, which flies through
							the air, and delivers the presents to the children in one single night.
							</p>
								
							<p>The name Christmas is derived from Christ's Mass, as Christmas is the time when Christ
							was born. It is an important part of the Christian liturgical year. Jesus Christ's birth is estimated 
							by modern historians to have been between 7th and 2nd BCE, though the month and day are unknown. The 
							Western Christian Church put  the celebration of his birth on Dec. 25th of the Gregorian Calendar. 
							Some Eastern Christian churches follow the same date, but on the Julian Calendar, which corresponds to 
							Jan. 7th on the Gregorian Calendar. The date was probably chosen to correspond with 9 months after 
							Jesus' conception, or to coincide with the winter solstice, as evidenced by a biblical verse calling 
							Jesus the, "Sun [sic] of Righteousness.</p>

							<p>The way the stories go, on Christmas Eve, Santa Claus puts all the presents for the children in a sack, which he
							puts on his sleigh. hitched to the sleigh are reindeer. They pull the sleigh, flying through the air. They then visit
							every house on the list, and come christmas morning, the children wake up to presents under the tree.
